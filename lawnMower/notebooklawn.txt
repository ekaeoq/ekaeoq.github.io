You've indicated all the hallmarks of someone who isn't interested in programming, but is interested in a career change and more
money. That is 100% the wrong mindset to enter the field with. I know many, many people who
entered the field because "hey lots of high
paying jobs" and were chewed up and spit out, because they lacked an intrinsic interest in the field itself.
