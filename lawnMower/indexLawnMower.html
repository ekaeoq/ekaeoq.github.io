				<cite>You've indicated all the hallmarks of someone who isn't interested in programming, but is interested in a career change and more
money. That is 100% the wrong mindset to enter the field with. I know many, many people who
entered the field because "hey lots of high
paying jobs" and were chewed up and spit out, because they lacked an intrinsic interest in the field itself.

				<cite>I remember the adrenaline rush when my code works how I wanted it to be. For that second you feel the world is by your fingertips.
It could be stressful sometimes but boring is not the word to use.

				I don’t know what kind of coding you do, but I “live to code. “There is no greater joy is writing code. But you mileage may vary. If coding is boring to you, maybe a career change might be useful.

It’s the flow, man. It’s like you sit down at 9, and suddenly you notice that your neck hurts, and your eyes are sore, and you blink and stretch, and look at the time, and it’s 11:30. Where did the time go? And you’ve coded a whole class with test cases and it works better than you imagined it. You feel like you really created something out of thin air, crystallized knowledge into executable form using the awesome power of your mind alone. It’s raw power, baby.

It keeps your powerful mind occupied, it opens your mind to endless possibility of thought. Just don’t question why? travel in it as long as you can you will fall in love with it.

Notice that if you google two completely different things, you bearly get any different results, ever wondered why that is? Is it
because programmers are the biggest fucking losers on the planet and therefore gatekeep their silly little skill, so they can be proud of
at least one thing in their pathetic lives? Is it because programming is so hard that no mortal should ever approach it unless they
have "intrinsic interest" that borders rationality? Or is it simply because programming allows those jim-dandys to have
some form of a superficial superiority complex? The answer is: I don't know. It's nothing new that for some whatever reason programmers
have an inherent narcissistic tendencies that span from nothing more than a worldwide spread scam, where <code>coding</code> is seen as 
something hard.
