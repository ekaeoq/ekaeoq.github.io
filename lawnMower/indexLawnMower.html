				<cite>You've indicated all the hallmarks of someone who isn't interested in programming, but is interested in a career change and more
money. That is 100% the wrong mindset to enter the field with. I know many, many people who
entered the field because "hey lots of high
paying jobs" and were chewed up and spit out, because they lacked an intrinsic interest in the field itself.

				<cite>I remember the adrenaline rush when my code works how I wanted it to be. For that second you feel the world is by your fingertips.
It could be stressful sometimes but boring is not the word to use.

				I don’t know what kind of coding you do, but I “live to code. “There is no greater joy is writing code. But you mileage may vary. If coding is boring to you, maybe a career change might be useful.

It’s the flow, man. It’s like you sit down at 9, and suddenly you notice that your neck hurts, and your eyes are sore, and you blink and stretch, and look at the time, and it’s 11:30. Where did the time go? And you’ve coded a whole class with test cases and it works better than you imagined it. You feel like you really created something out of thin air, crystallized knowledge into executable form using the awesome power of your mind alone. It’s raw power, baby.

It keeps your powerful mind occupied, it opens your mind to endless possibility of thought. Just don’t question why? travel in it as long as you can you will fall in love with it.

Notice that if you google two completely different things, you barely get any different results, ever wondered why that is? Is it
because programmers are the biggest fucking losers on the planet and therefore gatekeep their silly little skill, so they can be proud of
at least one thing in their pathetic lives? Is it because programming is so hard that no mortal should ever approach it unless they
have "intrinsic interest" that borders rationality? Or is it simply because programming allows those jim-dandys to have
some form of a superficial superiority complex? The answer is: I don't know. It's nothing new that for some whatever reason programmers
have an inherent narcissistic tendencies that span from nothing more than a worldwide spread scam, where <code>coding</code> is seen as 
something hard.

To me, coding is nothing more than mowing a lawn and more often than not, I find myself looking for a lost screw in the grass.
"Jebeno košenje trave" and "opet ne znam di je prokleti šraf" are terms that I use daily when dealing with almost
unavoidable coding mistakes or just stright up stupid bullshit that requires you to be on a autistc spectre not go ahead
and get rid of the lawn mower. I'll give you just the perfect example or everything stated above:

To quickly rundown the situation, for about 5-7 weeks I was unable to compile a single program I've written in that time. I don't
even want to remember how many time I've rewritten the same shit over and over again, just to get the most random error:
<br>
<hr>
				<code>
					Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64: <br>"UnparseableDateException::UnparseableDateException(std::__1::basic_string<char>, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> >)", referenced from: Date::GetDateFromString(std::__1::basic_string<char>, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> >) in Date-5996f4.o "UnparseableDateException::what() const", referenced from: Student::LoadFromFile(std::__1::basic_string<char>, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&) in Student—e903b7.o "typeinfo for UnparseableDateException", referenced from: GCC_except_table9 in Student—e903b7.o Date::GetDateFromString(std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> >) in Date-5996f4.o "vtable for UnparseableDateException", referenced from: UnparseableDateException::UnparseableDateException(UnparseableDateException const&) in Student—e903b7.o UnparseableDateException::—UnparseableDateException() in Student—e903b7.o UnparseableDateException::—UnparseableDateException() in Date-5996f4.o NOTE: a missing vtable usually means the first non—inline virtual member function has no definition. ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use —v to see invocation)

				The error itself was basically un-googlable, trying out &nbsp;<code>Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64</code> &nbsp;or&nbsp;
				<code>clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use —v to see invocation) </code>gave you a lot of answers but none of them
were even slightly similar to your problem, luckily I had a professor who took his time to look at my code, see no mistakes
in it and we collectively agreed that there is something wrong with the compiler that only god knows how to fix.
After a few compiler reinstalls, a laptop reset, using lambdas that made almost 0 sense to me, custom makefiles..
But I digress, all my problems went away with a simple flag <code>-std=c++11</code>. Maybe it was naive of me to think that the newest
version of c++ compiler would use at least the C++11 standard (at a time that didn't even cross my mind).

				Getting back on topic, the hard part about coding is staying perseverant, because coding is not hard. It's annoying,
tedious and mundane. If you find coding exciting, you should seriously get a reality check, because buying into this
programming glamour is dangerous, especially for lazy people like me(keep in mind, this is coming from someone who is
completely indulged in capitalism and CONsumerism - topic for another time tho). In retrospect, if asked me about 
programming a few years ago, or even a year ago, in its core, my answer wouldn't differ much from the previously 
mentioned quote: <cite>"Creation from pure thought!" </cite> &nbsp; Today, I can provide a better answer: Coding has nothing to do
with creativity or a lot of thinking for that matter, but everything that comes before the coding part can
legitimately be called a pure thought. Coding part is simply something that has to be done. It's a tool that turns
your ideas into something tactile, or just a converter for turning your professors' shitty assignments into a grade, it's
nothing more than mowing a lawn. Naturally your lawn mower is gonna get rusty if you don't take care of it, which
inevitably makes mowing your lawn even harder. Remember, <code>coding is just a tool, that's all it is.</code>
