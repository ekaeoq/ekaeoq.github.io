				<p class="novo">Back when I started writing this article I wOuLd PrOuDly sAy I aM a Consumptionist as a term of my own, since it doesn't exist in the Cambridge Dictionary. In my book, a consumptionist would be someone who extensively researches what he buys, instead of just blindly buying shit like an average r/consumeproduct post, funnily enough, if you were to google the term "consumptionist" you would get redirected to sites about consumerism, how ironic. My conclusion would be, that calling yourself a "consumptionist" is the same as being a consumer on steroids, because research doesn't justify overspending. Perhaps you could describe consumerism as overconsumption, but in reality wordplay comes down to the same shit, "both him and I" are capitalisms' favorite pets.</p>

				<p class="novo">Notice that if you google two completely different things, you barely get any different results, ever wondered why that is? Is it because programmers are the biggest fucking losers on the planet and therefore gatekeep their silly little skill, so they can be proud of at least one thing in their pathetic lives?  Is it because programming is so hard that no mortal should ever approach it unless they have "intrinsic interest" that borders rationality?</p>
