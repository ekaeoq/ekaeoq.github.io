				<p>This topic is very dear to me, sometimes I wonder if I'm allowed to speak on this matter, because, while I hate it
I also encureage it at the same time. Before anything, I want to get rid of the bullshit definition semantics; here's the
definition of consumerism:
</p>
<cite>Consumerism is a social and economic order that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts.</cite>
<br><hr> Additionally: <br><br> <cite>the supply of goods would grow beyond consumer demand, and so manufacturers turned to planned obsolescence
	and advertising to manipulate consumer spending.<hr></cite>

<p>While there are countless definitions of what consumption is, in its core it's simply:</p>
<cite>the action of using up a resource.<hr></cite>
<p>
Back when I started writing this article I wOuLd PrOuDly sAy I aM a Consumptionist as a term of my own, since it 
doesn't exist in the Cambridge Dictionary. In my book, a consumptionist would be someone who extensively researches what he buys,
instead of just blindly buying shit like an average r/consumeproduct post, funnily enough, if you were to google
the term "consumptionist" you would get redirected to sites about consumerism, how ironic. My conclusion would be,
that calling yourself a "consumptionist" is the same as being a consumer on steroids, because research doesn't justify
overspending.
Perhaps you could describe consumerism as overconsumption, but in reality wordplay comes down to the same shit, "both
him and I" are capitalisms' favorite pets.

Allow me to digress to capitalism for a moment. Having this beautiful problem in the first place is a direct consequence
of Laissez-faire "allowance", of course the best thing that's ever happened to this planet, have a taste of this stunning
example, in New York: a parking spot makes more hourly than a cashier, to make matters worse(keep in mind we're talking averages
here) in a month, a parking spot in NYC makes the same amount of money as 3 average workers from Somalia in a year and that's, my
friends, a true beauty of capitalism
